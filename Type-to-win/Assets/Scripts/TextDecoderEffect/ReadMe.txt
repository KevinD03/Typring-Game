Thank you for purchasing Text Decoder Effect!
This script was created by Matt Jarvis and is not for resale.

How to use:

1) Create a text component and attach the 'TextDecoder' or 'TextMeshProDecoder' script to an object with Text or TextMeshProUGUI component respectively.
    1.1) The method to begin the text decoder effect is added to start method by default. To change, simply call the method at any other appropriate time.

2) Drag components into the public variables stated on the script in the inspector.

	4.1) Randomize Delay - This is the time for each letter change
	4.2) Text Show Delay - The text will begin to reveal after this amount of time
	4.3) Force Text - This will force the text to show if reveal has not completed after the 'Force Time' variable
	4.4) Force Time - If force text is enabled, the text will be show completely after this amount of time (Time starts after text show delay)
